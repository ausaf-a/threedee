# threedee
Basic Three.JS starter environment for 3D Graphics programming using JavaScript. 

# motivation 
i think visualizing things is cool, but in 3d seemed hard. then i found three.js; i wanted to learn this library so that i can later build visualizations that use 3D graphics, since right now there don't seem to be many websites that use them. 

# what i learned
some javascript, and how to use the three.js sdk build a scene and place objects in an environment. also how to use skyboxes.
